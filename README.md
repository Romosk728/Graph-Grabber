Import a Graph, define its ranges, and GRAAAB its data :3

Here are some known issues:

If some buttons are not visible, try enlarging the window

Some file formats are not supported

If you want to use the zoom function, make sure that the 
graph have a good amount of space on all four sides, this 
is due to a issus in the zoom function when zooming outside
canvas.

You may need to use external drawing tools to draw assist
lines in some cases.

This is the first functional build, I am working on more
features.
