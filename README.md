Import a Graph, define its ranges, and GRAAAB its data :3

!!!Download the .exe file if you just want to use it!!!


Here are some known issues:

Cursor is not visible in the main window.

If some buttons are not visible, try enlarging the window.

Some file formats are not supported.

Feel free to play with the config file, but some changes
may cause crashes.

If you want to use the zoom function, make sure that the 
graph have a good amount of space on all four sides, this 
is due to a issus in the zoom function when zooming outside
canvas.

You may need to use external drawing tools to draw assist
lines in some cases.

This is the first functional build, I am working on more
features.
