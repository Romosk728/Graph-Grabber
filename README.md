Import a graph, define its axis, and GRAAAAB its data :3 

It's useable at this point, but there are some known issues:

If some buttons are not visible, try to make the window larger.

If you want to use the zoom function, make sure the graph has a large enough frame,
this is due to a bug when zooming outside the canvas.

Feel free to play with the config file, but changes to some values may cause crashes.

If you want to measure maps (one-dimensional scale) and similar stuff, use other tools to draw guidelines to define its axis.

This is just the first functional build. I am working on more features :3
