# Graph-Grabber Build 3.0
Import a graph, define its axies, and GRAAAAB its data :3
Its useable at this point, but there are some known issues:

If some buttons are not visible, try to make the window larger

If you want to use the zoom function, make sure the graph has a large enough frame,
this is due to a bug when zooming outside the canvas.

Feel free to play with the config file, but change to some values may cause crashes

If you want to measure maps (one dimensional scale) and similar stuff, use other 
tools to draw guidelines to define its axis.

This is just the first functional build, I am working on more features :3
